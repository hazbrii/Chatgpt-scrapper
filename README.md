# Chatgpt-scrapper
This porject is about generating a dataset to create a chatbot, such data can be difficult to find so I used chatgpt to generate question and responses with intention and topic.
I have used selenium so you must install webdriver chrome https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
"chatgpt_handle" file will generate the data and then "chatgpt_scrap" will get the data (I know it's not the best solution for now, Feel free to add more features)
